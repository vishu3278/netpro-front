    "statsText": "India’s workforce is its greatest strength, but to stay globally competitive, the country must skill and upskill millions every year. Despite numerous initiatives, most training programs still operate in isolation, with limited access, outdated infrastructure, and little visibility into outcomes. Many individuals struggle to find relevant opportunities, while institutions lack the data to measure real impact. The result is a fragmented skilling ecosystem that falls short of its potential. A connected, technology-driven approach is essential to bring scale, transparency, and accountability to India’s skilling mission, empowering citizens with the tools they need to thrive in a changing economy.",
