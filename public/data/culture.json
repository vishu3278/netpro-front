    "statsText": "India’s cultural heritage is one of the richest in the world, yet much of it had long remained under-documented and inaccessible. We worked to change that by developing scalable digital systems that preserve, catalogue, and showcase the country’s diverse cultural assets. Through technology, we made centuries of art, manuscripts, and traditions accessible beyond physical boundaries, connecting museums, institutions, and citizens to a shared national legacy. Our work not only safeguarded these invaluable records but also ensured that India’s cultural identity continues to inspire future generations.",
