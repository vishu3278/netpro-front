    "statsText": "India’s healthcare landscape is vast and diverse and yet access remains uneven, particularly across rural and underserved regions. Patient records are often fragmented across multiple systems, making continuity of care a challenge. Public health monitoring still relies heavily on manual reporting, delaying insights that could save lives.   These gaps don’t stem from intent, but from infrastructure. To truly strengthen healthcare delivery, India needs scalable digital systems that connect citizens, institutions, and data  ensuring that every patient, regardless of where they live, can access timely, reliable, and quality care.",
